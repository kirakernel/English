The UK's blue-chip index hit an all-time high of 7,906.58 on Fiday, amid hopes that global inflation is easing and central banks may be reaching the end of a sustained period of interest rate rises.

The FTSE 100 peaked at that level before ending the day at a new closing high of 7,901.80. Both the intraday high and the closing high were above the prevoius record set on 22 May 2018, when the FTSE 100 closed at 7,877.45.

It gained as investors hoped that the inflation shock from energy prices may be easing and that central banks may coming to the end of a period of aggressive rate hikes.

"Despite last year's equity market volatility and a slowing global economy, the FTSE 100 is defying the doom and gloom," said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.
