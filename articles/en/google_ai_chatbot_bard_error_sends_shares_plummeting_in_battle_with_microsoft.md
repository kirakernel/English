Google's riposte to ChatGPT has **got off** to an embarrassing start after its new artificial intelligence-powered chatbot gave a wrong answer in a promotional video, as investors **wiped more than $100bn off** the value of the search engine's parent company, Alphabet.

The **sell-off** on Wednesday came amid investor fears that Microsoft, which is deploying an ChatGPT-powered version of its Bing search engine, will damage Google's business. Alphabet stock **slid** by 9% during regular trading in the US but was flat after hours.

Experts pointed out that promotional material for Bard, Google's competitor to Microsoft-baked ChatGPT, contained an error in the response by the chatbot to: "What new discoveries from the James Webb space telescope (JWST) can tell my nine-year old about?"

Bard's response - in a video demo posted online- includes an answer suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system, or **exoplanets**.

The error was picked up by experts including Grant Templay, an astrophysicist at the US Center for Astrophysics, who tweeted: "Not to be a \~well, actually\~ **jerk**, and I'm sure Bard will be impressive, but for the record: JWST did not take 'the very first image of a planet outside our solar system'".

Bruce Macintosh, the director of University of California Observatories, tweeted: "Speaking as someone who imaged an exoplanet 14 years before JWST was launched, it feels like you should find a better example?"

Google said the error, first reported by Reuters, underlined the need for testing new systems. Bard has been released to a team of specialist testers and has yet to be **rolled out** to the public.

"This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our trusted tester program," a Google spokesperson said. "We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information."

Bard is based on a so-called large language AI model, a type of neural network, which mimics the underlying architecture of the brain in computer form. It is fed vast amounts of text from the internet in a process that teaches it how to generate responses to text-based prompts. However, this can aslo lead to the chatbot repeating erros from the information that it absorbs.

Google also gave a live-steamed presentation in Paris on Wednesday that did not include details of how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event in which it announced that it was launching a public version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated.

Gil Luria, a senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said: "While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen **asleep** on implementing this techology into their search product.

Google has been **scrambling over** the last few weeks to catch up on search and that caused the announcement to be rushed and the embarrassing mess-up of posting a wrong answer during their demo."

Alphabet, whose main business is Google, is **coming off** a disappoingting fourth **quarter** as advertisers cut spending. Microsoft is a key backer of the company behind ChatGPT, the San Francisco-based OpenAI, and its move to integrate ChatGPT technology into its products including search has forced Google, also a big investor in AI, to take action.

"People are starting to question: is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google's really **bread-and-butter** business? said King Lip, the chief strategist at Baker Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares.

Lip cautioned that concerns about Alphabet may be **overblown**, saying: "I think still Bing is a far, far **cry away** from Google's search capabilities."
