## **Parents** and brother of Abby Choi's ex-husband arrested after police make **grisly** discovery at rented village home

Hong Kong police have made three arrests over the murder and dismemberment of a 28-year-old model after what authorities allege was a financial dispute with her ex-husband's family.

The partial remains of the influencer Abby Choi, who last week appeared on the digital cover of L'Officiel Monaco **fashion** magazine, were found in a village house, police said.

Supt Alan Chung told reporters on Saturday that police were still trying to locate the head, after disclosing that a woman's **limbs** had been discovered inside a refrigerator.

The father, mother and **elder** brother of Choi's ex-husband have been arrested and will be charged with murder, he added. The whereabouts of her ex-husband were unknown.

"We believe the victim and her ex-husband's family had many financial disputes involving huge sums," Chung said. "Someone was dissatistied with how the victim handled her **assets**."

Choi was first reported missing on Wednesday. She was allegedly last seen by her ex-husband's brother, who also worked as her chauffeur. Police also alleged the family had earlier lied to mislead investigators.

The village house had been recently rented and was unfurnished, suggesting it was **set up** **to dispose** of Choi's body, Chung added.
