Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has accused Jair Bolsonaro's far-right administration of committing genocide against Yanomami people of the Amazon, amid public outrage over a humanitarian catastrophe in the country's largest Indigenous territory.

Lula visited the Amazon state of Roraima on Saturday to denounce the plight of the Yanomami, whose supposedly protected lands have been plunged into crisis by government neglect and the explosion of illegal mining.

"More than a humanitarian crisis, what we saw in Roraima was a genocide. A premeditated crime against the Yanomami, committed by a government impervious to the suffering of the Brazilian people," Lula tweeted on Sunday, one day after visiting an overclowded clinic for Yanomami patients in Roraime's capital, Boa Vista.
