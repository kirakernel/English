# Nicola Bulley: family friends condemn 'vile' theories as search continues[^1]

## Police warn about social media speculation over missing woman as news images released from the morning she disappeared

Police searching for Nicola Bulley have condemned elements of social media speculation as family frieds hit out at "vile" theories being posted online and new images of 45-year-old on the morning she disappeared were released.

The search for the mother-of-wtwo entered its second week with police continuing to pursue the teory that Bulley fell into the river while walking her dog in the Lancashire village of St Michael's on the Wyre.

Lancashire constabulary said its inquires into the case were extensive and included "speaking to as many members of the public as possible".

In a statement the force added: "The speculation and abuse on social media aimed st some people who are merely assisting our enquiry is totally unacceptable.

"We would urge people to remember that we are investigating the disappearance of Nicola, and the priority is Nicola and her family. We want to find her and provide answers to her family."

On Sunday afternoon a friend of Bulley released new images from the morning she disappeared, Friday 27 January, showing her loading up her car.

Police believe the most likely reason for Bulley's disappearance is that she fell in the Wyre.
