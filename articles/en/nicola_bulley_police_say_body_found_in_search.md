# Body found in search for missing woman Nicola Bulley, say police

# **Mortgage** adviser, 45, went missing while walking her pet after **dropping off** daughters at school

A body has been found in the search for the missing woamn Nicola Bulley after a **tipoff** by members of the public, police have said.

Bulley, 45, a mortgage adviser from Inskip, Lancashire, vanished while walking her dog after dropping off her daughters, six and nine, at school more than three weeks ago, on 27 January.


Lancashire constabulary said no formal identification had yet been carried out on the body, but that Bulley's family had been informed.

The force said it was called at 11.36am on Sunday to reports of a body in the River Wyre, close to Rawcliffe Road, within a mile of where Bulley was last seen.

"An underwater search team and specialist officers have subsequently attended the scene, entered the water, and have sadly recovered a body. No formal identification has yet been carried out, so we are unable to say whether this is Nicola Buller at this time," Lacanshire constabulary said in  a statement.

"Procedures to identify the body are ongoing. We are currently treating the death as unexplained. Nicola's family have been infromed of developments and our thoughts are with them at this most difficult of times. We ask their privacy is respected."

The body was found in the river about half a mile downstream from the village of St Michael's. Police divers were seen searching by undergrowth at the river's edge on Sunday morning, serveral metres below the banking on Rawcliffe Road.

A dead tree appeared to have fallen into the river there some time ago, with decaying reeds obscuring the water's edge from some angle.

After the road reopened on Sunday afternoon, a steady stream of local people and crime scene tourists visited the spot, after seeing photographs of the search on social media.

For more than three weeks, the community in this small Lancashire village had been desperate for news of the missing mother. Every other lamppost and telegraph pole bears laminated "missing" posters, appealing for information about Bulley's disappearance.

Photographs of her smilling face were printed on banners placed at road junctions, in the hope of jogging the memories of motorists who may have seen her the morning she went missing.

But as the days went on and detectives stuck to their hypothesis that the river had claimed Bulley, the chances of her being found alive grew ever slimmer. A formal identification of the body will confirm whether the tragic search has come to an end.

The home secretary, Suella Braverman, tweeted: "These are heart-breaking and distressing developments. My thoughts remain with Nicola's family at this extremely difficult time."

Within a week of her going missing, police said they belived she had fallen into the river while walking her dog, Willow, along the Wyre.

Piecing together CCTV footage, mobile phone data and sightings from people who knew Bulley, detectives believed there was only a 10-minute window when she was out of sight. Her phone, which was still connected to a work call, was found on a bench by the river, alongside Willows's harness.

Bulley's disappearance sparked unusually strong public interest, with amateur detectives and Youtubers making ghoulish pilgrimages to the area as they shared their unsubstantiated theories on the case.


Some were served with dispersal notices, forcing them to leave the area, amid reports that properties near to the river had been broken into by unqualified sleuths.

Three weeks after Bulley went missing, police took the unusual step of revealing that she had previously had "significant issues with alcohol which were brought on by her ongoing struggles with menopause and that these struggles had resurfaced over recent months".

Officers had attended the family home on 10 January amid a "report of concern for welfare", the force said.

The disclosure of such personal information prompted widespread consternation, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, saying he was "concerned" about the disclosures.

Lancashire constabulary admitted that it was "an unusual step for us to take to go into this level of detail about someone's private life", but said they did so to avoid speculation or misinterpretation.
