# Publisher of Roald Dahl books in French has 'no plans' for rewrite

## Galliward says it will not be following English example and making changes to the texts

The French publishers of Roald Dahl have **ruled out** any changes to the late British author's translated books after it emerged that English editions were being rewritten for modern audiences.

Publishers Puffin have made hundreds of changes to characters and language in Dahl's stories for children, including making the diminutive Oompa-Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory gender neutral and calling Augusts Gloop enormous rather than fat.

Mrs Twit in The Twits is no longer ugly but beastly, while the Cloud-Men in James and the Giant Peach are now "Cloud-People".

"Rhis rewrite only concerns Britain," a spokesperson for the French publishers Gallimard said. "We have never chnaged Roald Dahl's writings before, and we have no plans to do so today."

Gallimard first published James et La Grosse Peche (James and the Giant Peach) in 1996, and Charlie et la Chocolaterie in 1967. There have been several new editions of both **since**.

Although less famous than in the English-speaking world, Dahl's children's books have a loyal following in France and are all available in Gallimard's Folio collection of young people's literature.

The British publisher's decision to rewrite led to a wave of criticism, with writers including Salman Rushdie, freedom of expression body Pen and even the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, all weighing in on the debate.

In France, the **translator** and **commentator** Bérengère Viennot wrote on the Slate.fr website that "a rewritten Roald Dahl **novel** is no longer a Roald Dahl novel".

Calling the changes "unacceptable on several levels", Viennot said: "They're not **fooling** anybody, this is **censorship** **disguised** as an update."

A French teacher, Marie Bernard, posted a picture of Dahl books on Twitter with titles, replacing Lamb to the Slaughter with "Tofu to the Slaughter", adding the subtitle "and other stories that scare nobody" instead of the original "and other scary stories".
