Ricin, a deadly poison, can be made from waste material produced in the processing of castor beans. It can be produced as a powder, mist or liquid, or in pellet form.

In each letter, Ferrier wrote that she included a "special gift", adding that if it "doesn't work, I will find a better recipe for another poison". She also wrote: "or I might use my gun when I will be able to come" and concluded: "Enjoy."

According to court documents, the letter to Trump also stated: "You ruin USA and lead them to disaster. I have US cousins, then I don't want the next four years with you as president. Give up and remove your application for this election."
