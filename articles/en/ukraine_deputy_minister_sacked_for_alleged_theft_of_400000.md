Ukraine's deputy infrastructure minister, Vasyl Lozinskyi, has been detained and dismissed from his post for allegedly stealing $400,000 (320, 000 pounds) intended to purchasing aid, including generators, according to Ukraines state anti-corruption detectives and presecutors.

After the news emerged, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed that old ways of corruption would not return to Ukraine.

"I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair [a state position] used to live," said Zalenskiy in his night address on Sunday without specifically mentioning the case.
