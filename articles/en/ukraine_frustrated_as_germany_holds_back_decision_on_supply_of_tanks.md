Germany has declined to take a decision on whether to give Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine at a special
international summit, prompting frustration in Kyiv and a warning from Poland that lives could be lost
because of hesitation in Berlin.

It had been hoped in Europe and the US that Germany would at least allow Leopards owned by countries
such as Poland and Finland to be exported, but despite days pleading, Berlin's newly appointed defense
minister said no final decision had been taken.

Instead, Boris Pistorius said on the sidelines of the 50-nation meeting at the Ramstein US air force base in Germany on Friday that he had asked his ministry to "undertake an examination of the stocks"
of the tanks available.

Although it was the closest Germany has come to suggesting it might be contemplating the use of the tanks
in the conflict, it provoked a number of pointed comments from Ukraine and its allies as the meeting broke up without progress on what has come to be seen as the core issue.
