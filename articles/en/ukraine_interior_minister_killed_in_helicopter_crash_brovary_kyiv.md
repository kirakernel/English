At least 14 people including Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, and other senior officials
have been killed after a helicopter crashed by a kindergarten in a suburb of Kyiv.

A number of children at the school in Brovary were among the casualities after debris hit the building.
The most recent update, on Wednesday afternoon, suggest one child has been killed, after previous report
that the number was at least three.

Officials gave no immediate account of the cause of the crash. The SBU state security service said it was
investigating possible causes including a breach of flight rules, a technical malfunction and the intentional destruction of the helicopter.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described the crash as "a terrible tragedy" on a "black morning". "The pain is unspeakable, " he wrote on Telegram.

Monastyrsky, who was responsible for the police and security in Ukraine, is the most senior Ukrainian official to die since the war began. The national police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said Monastyrsky was killed along with his deputy and other senior ministry officials.

The regional governor said 18 people had been killed, but emergency services later announced a death
toll of 15 and said 25 others had been injured, including 10 children.

"There were children and ... staff in the nursery at the time of this tragedy. Everyone has now been
evacuated. There are casualities," The Kyiv regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, wrote on Telegram.
