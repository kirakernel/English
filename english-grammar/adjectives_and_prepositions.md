Look at these examples to see how adjectives are used with prepositions.

## Grammar Explanation

Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.

However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (**-ing** form).

### With at

We use **at** with adjectives like **_good/bad/amazing/brilliant/terrible_**, etc. to talk about skills and abilities.

- > He's really **good at** English.
* > She's **amazing at** the piano.
+ > They're **terrible at** organazing anything.
- > I'm not very **good at** drawing.


### With about

We often use **about** with adjectives of feelings like **_angry/excited/happy/nervous/sad/stressed/worried_**, etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.

- > I'm **angry about** the decision.
* > He's **nervous about** the presentation.
+ > She's **excited about** the new job.
- > They were **worried about** the exam.

### With of

However, sometimes we use **of** with feelings.

- > She was **afraid of** telling her mum.
* > I'm **frightened of** having an accident.
+ > He's **scared of** flying.
- > You should be **proud of** your progress.
