## Grammar explanation

Here are some of the most important things to know about using articles.

### Jobs
When we say what people's jobs are, we usually use **a/an**.

- He's **an** architect.
* She's **a** scientist.
+ My grandmother was **a** teacher.


### Singular nouns
Singular, countable nouns always have an article – **a/an** or **the** (_or another determiner – my, your, this, that, etc._).

We use **a/an** – the indefinite article – when we talk about something for the first time, or something that is part of a group or type.

- I saw **a** good film yesterday.
* Do you want **a** drink?

We use **a** when the word that follows it begins with a **consonant sound**. We use **an** when it's followed by a **vowel sound**. This makes pronunciation easier.

- She has **a** university degree.
* It took me **an** hour to get home.

We use **the** – the definite article – when the listener already knows which thing we are talking about because it was mentioned before or because there's only one of them.

- I'm going to take **the** dog for a walk.
* Have you seen **the** car key?
+ They go to **the** school next to **the** bridge.

### Things in general
When we talk about things in general, we normally use a plural or uncountable noun with no article.

- Birds eat worms.
* Water freezes at 0°C.
+ Children need a lot of sleep.


### Particular groups of things
When we talk about a particular group of things, we use **the**.

- We went to **the** zoo and saw **the** kangaroos. _(These are the particular kangaroos in that zoo – not kangaroos in general.)_
