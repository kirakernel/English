## Grammar explanation

Here are some ways we use articles in common phrases and place names.

### Common phrases

We don't usually use an article in expressions with **bed**, **work** and **home**.

- go to bed / be in bed
* go to work / be at work / start work / finish work
+ go home / be at home / get home / stay at home

We also don't normally use an article in expressions with **school**, **university**, **prison** and **hospital**.

- start school / go to school / be at school
- go to university / be at university
- be sent to prison / go to prison / be in prison
- go to hospital / be in hospital

But we usually use **the** if someone is just **visiting the place**, and not there as a **student/prisoner/patient**, etc.

* My son has started school now. I went to **the** school to meet his teacher.
* I went to **the** prison a lot when I was a social worker.
* I'm at **the hospital**. My sister has just had a baby.
