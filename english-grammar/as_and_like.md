## Grammar explanation

**as and like** are often confused since they can both be used for comparisons. There are, however, important differences.

### Making comparisons

#### as + adjective + as and as much as

We often use the structure **as + adjective + as** or **as much as** to say if something has, or doesn't have, the same amount of that quality as something else. 

* She loves curry **as much as** I do.
* He's not **as tall as** his brother.
* It's not **as expensive as** the other hotel.
* That dog is **as big as** that child!

You also have to use as in the expression the **same as**.

+ Your phone is **the same as** mine.
+ Texting is not **the same as** speaking in person.

#### like + noun

In the following comparisons, **like** is followed by a noun or a pronoun to say that two things are similar.

- He's **like** a father to me.
- She's acting **like** a child.
- It's **like** a burger but with big mushrooms instead of bread.
- There are lots of people **like** us.

It is also common to make comparisons using **like** with verbs of the senses.

* She looks **like** her mother.
* It sounds **like** a cat.
* Nothing tastes **like** homemade lemonade.
* It smells **like** medicine.

#### as if/as though + clause

**As if and as though** can be used to compare a real situation to an imaginary situation. They are followed by a clause (a subject and verb).

+ You look **as if** you've seen a ghost.
+ I felt **as if** I was floating above the ground.
+ You talk **as though** we're never going to see each other again.

### Giving examples

We can say **like or such as** to give examples.

We can use **as + noun** to talk about a job or function.
