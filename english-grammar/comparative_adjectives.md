# Comparative adjectives

- The city is **more interesting than** the countryside.
- This house is **older than** my house.
- She's **better at cooking now than** before.

## Grammar explanation

We use comparative adjectives to compare two things or show change. The comparative form depends on the number of syllables in the adjective.

### Adjectives with one syllable
To make comparative forms with **one-syllable adjectives**, we usually add **-er**:

* old - older
* clean - cleaner
* slow - slower

If an adjective ends in **-e**, we add **-r**:

+ safe - safer
+ nice - nicer

If an adjective **ends in a vowel and a consonant**, we usually **double the consonant**:

- big - bigger
- hot - hotter

### Adjectives with two or more syllables

If a **two-syllable adjective** ends in **a consonant** and **-y**, we change **-y** to **-i** and add **-er**:

* noisy - noisier
* happy - happier
* easy - easier

We use **more** to make comparative forms for most other **two-syllable adjectives** and for all **adjectives with three or more syllables**:

+ crowded - more crowded
+ stressful - more stressful
+ dangerous - more dangerous

**Exception:** You can either add **-er/-r** or use **more** with **some two-syllable adjectives**, such as **common, cruel, gentle, handsome, likely, narrow, pleasant, polite, simple** and **stupid**.

- I think life in the countryside is **simpler than** in the city.
- It's **more simple** to live in the city because everything you need is there.

### Irregular adjectives

The adjectives **good, bad and far** have irregular comparative forms:

* good - better
* bad - worse
* far - further/farther

### Than

When we want to say which person or thing we are comparing with, we can use **than**:

+ Their house is **cleaner than** ours.
+ Traffic is **slower in the city than** in the countryside.
+ After the race I was **more tired than** Anne.
