* I've brought **a few** friends.
* There's **a bit of** milk left.
* It needs **a little** more work.

We use **few** and **very little** to show that we are talking about a small amount. Often we feel this amount is not enough or less than we expected. **Few** is for countable nouns and **very little** is for uncountable nouns.

+ **Few** people came to the meeting.
+ There are **few** places where you can still see these birds.
+ We have **very little** time.

Note that you can use **little** without **very**, but it is less common and sounds quite formal.
