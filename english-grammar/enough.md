## Grammar explanation

**enough** means **as much as necessary**. It can be used with an **adjective, an adverb, a verb or a noun**. It can also act as a **pronoun**.

### With adjectives and adverbs

**enough** comes after **adjectives** and **adverbs**.

* I'm not **tall enough** to reach the top shelf.
* Your marks are **good enough** to study engineering at university.
* I couldn't write **quickly enough** and I ran out of time.
* I've helped at conferences **often enough** to know what can go wrong.

### With verbs

**enough** comes after **verbs**.

+ I make sure I **drink enough** during the day.
+ I don't **read enough** but I'm going to start downloading books to my phone. 

### With nouns

**enough** comes before **nouns**.

- There isn't **enough bread** to make sandwiches.
- Have you got **enough money**?

### As a pronoun

**enough** can also be used **without a noun**. 

* I'll get some more chairs. There aren't **enough**.
* A: Do you want more coffee? B: No, I've had **enough**, thanks.

We know what the **noun** is because of the **context**.

### With an adjective and a noun

When **enough** is used with an **adjective and a noun**, two positions are possible but the meaning changes.

+ We haven't got **big enough envelopes**. 
+ We haven't got **enough big envelopes**.

When **enough is after the adjective** _(big enough envelopes)_, it describes the _adjective_ – **the envelopes are too small**. When **enough is before the adjective** _(enough big envelopes)_, it describes _the noun phrase_ – **we have some big envelopes, but we need more**.

### enough of

We normally only use **enough of** when it is followed by a **determiner or a pronoun (a/an/the, this/that, my/your/his, you/them, etc.)**.

- There isn't **enough of that bread** to make sandwiches for everyone.
- I've seen **enough of his work** to be able to recommend him.
- There's **enough of us** to make a difference.
