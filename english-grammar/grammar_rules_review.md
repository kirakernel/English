* **Place** — Detroit
+ **Thing** — Desk
- **Quality** — Width
* **Animal** — Dog
+ **Idea** — Independence

_Nouns:_ **Person — Maria , Place — City, and Thing — Detergent**

### The functions of nouns

Nouns sometimes function differently in sentences. **For example:**

* **Object of Preposition:** He gave the ice cream to Maria
+ **Subject complement:** The best customer is Maria

> _Grammar vocabulary:_ Nominal means any word, or group of words, used as a noun. The nominal word used in the original noun example is Maria.
