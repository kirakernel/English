## Grammar explanation

We often use **just, yet, still and already** with the present perfect because they are related to the present moment. This page focuses on the meaning and use of these words when they are used with the present perfect.

### just

**Just** used with the present perfect means **a short time before**.

* I've **just** seen Susan coming out of the cinema.
* Mike's **just** called. Can you ring him back, please?
* Have you **just** taken my pen?!

**Just** comes **between** the auxiliary verb **(have/has)** and the **past participle**.

### yet

**Yet** used with the present perfect means **at any time up to now**. We use it to emphasise that we expect something to happen soon. **Yet (in this context)** is only used in **negative** sentences and **questions**.

+ Have you finished your homework **yet**?
+ I haven't finished it **yet**. I'll do it after dinner.
+ A. Where's Sam? B: He hasn't arrived **yet**.

**Yet** comes **at the end** of the **sentence** or **question**.

### still

**Still** used with the present perfect means that **something hasn't happened**. We use it to emphasise that we expected the thing to happen earlier. **Still (in this context)** is only used in **negative sentences**.

- I've been waiting for an hour and the bus **still** hasn't come.
- They promised me that report yesterday but they **still** haven't finished it.
- She **still** hasn't replied to my email. Maybe she's on holiday.

**Still** comes between the **subject (the bus, they, etc.)** and **auxiliary verb (haven't/hasn't)**.

### already

**Already** used with the present perfect means **before now**. We use it to emphasise that something happened before something else or earlier than expected.
