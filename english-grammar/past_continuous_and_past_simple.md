# Past Continuous and Past Simple

- When I **woke up** this morning, it **was snowing**.
- I **was sleeping** when **you called** me.

## Grammar explanation

**The past continuous** and the **past simple** help us to show how two past actions or situations are connected.

### Past simple

**The past simple** shows us that an action was in the past, not in the present. Regular past simple verbs have **-ed** at the end _(e.g. called, played, arrived)_. Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound _(e.g. wake - woke, break - broke, feel - felt)_.

* My parents **called** me yesterday.
* I **woke up** early this morning.
* Sam **played** basketball when he **was** at university.

We make the negative with **didn't** and **the infinitive verb**.

+ My parents **didn't call** me yesterday.
+ I **didn't wake up** early this morning.

We make the question form with **did** and then the **subject** and **infinitive verb**.

- **Did** you **wake up** early this morning?
- **Did** Sam **play** basketball when he **was** at university?



### Past continuous

**The past continuous** shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.

* What **were** you **doing** at 8 p.m. last night? I **was studying**.

This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.

**The past continuous** can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.

+ We **were cleaning** the house all morning.

We make **the past continuous** with **was** or **were** and the **-ing** form of the verb.

- She couldn't come to the party. She **was working**.
- Three years ago, we **were living** in my home town.
- I **tried** to give him some advice, but he **wasn't listening**.
- What **were** you **doing** this time last year?


### Past continuous and past simple

When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that **the past simple action** happened in the middle of **the past continuous action**, while it was in progress.

* While I **was studying**, I suddenly **felt** sleepy.

We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.

+ I **broke** my leg when I **was skiing**.
+ As I **was going** to work, I **saw** an old friend.
+ We **were watching** television when the power **went** off.

Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?

- When the guests **arrived**, Jane **was cooking** dinner.
- When the guests **arrived**, Jane **cooked** dinner.

In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking.
