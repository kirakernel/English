## Grammar explanation

We can use **possessive 's** to talk about the relationship between people or to say who owns something. **Possessive 's** always comes after _a noun or a name_.

We often use **possessive 's** or **s'** when we talk about family and friends.

* Grandma and Grandpa are my **mum's parents**.
* **Maria's best friend** is Juanita.
* **My cousins' birthdays** are both in January.

We can also use it to say that something belongs to someone.

+ That's **Roberto's flat**. He's got a flat in the city centre.
+ **Kim's hair** is very long. She's got long, black hair.
+ **My parents' garden** is beautiful. They grow a lot of flowers.

When it is one person who owns something, we usually use **'s**.

- **Our friend's car** is red. She loves it.
- **Simon's phone** is new. He bought it yesterday.
- Can you see **Amira's keys**? She can't find them.

It is possible to use more than one possessive in a phrase.

* We had lunch at my **friend's father's house**.

If a name or noun ends in **s**, we can add either ' or **'s**. The pronunciation can be _-/zɪz/ or /sɪz/_.

+ Is that __James' bag__?
+ That's my __boss's__ office.

If the thing belongs to more than one person, we usually add **'** after the **s** of **the plural noun**.

- **Our friends' house** is in the mountains. They moved there last year.
- **My grandparents' dog** is called Bertie.
- **The twins' school** is closed today.

If the plural noun is irregular and doesn't end in **s**, we add **'s**.

* This is **our children's school**.
* **The women's clothes** are on the second floor.
* **A lot of people's eyes** are brown.

If something belongs to more than one person, and we give a list of names, the **'s** comes after the last name in the list.

+ Liam is **Anne and Gary's son**.

Remember that **s** at the end of a word without an apostrophe **(')** can make it plural, but this doesn't show possession.

- I've got two brothers.
- Are those your keys?
