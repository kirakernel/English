# Question Forms

- **Is he** a teacher?
- **Does she eat** meat?
- **When did you get** here?
- **How much does a train ticket cost**?

# Grammar explanation
To make questions, we often put the verb before the subject. This is called inversion.

|Affirmative	|Question
|---------------|--------
|I am late.	|Am I late?
|I can help.	|Can I help?
|She is sleeping.	|Is she sleeping?
|We have met before.	|Have we met before?


If there is a question word (**why, what, where, how, etc.**), it goes before the verb.

|Question	|Question with question word
|-----------|---------------------------
|Are you late?	|Why are you late?
|Was she there?	|When was she there?
|Can I help?	|How can I help?
|Have we met before?	|Where have we met before?


This is true for sentences with **be**, sentences that have auxiliary verbs **(e.g. They are waiting. She has finished.)** and sentences with modal verbs **(can, will, should, might, etc.)**.

### Questions in the present simple and past simple

For other verbs in the **present simple**, we use the auxiliary verb **do/does** in the question.

|Affirmative	|Question	|Question with question word
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------
|You work at home.  	|Do you work at home?	|Where do you work?
|It costs £10. 	|Does it cost £10?	|How much does it cost?

### We use the auxiliary verb did in the past simple.

|Affirmative	|Question	|Question with question word
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------
|She went home. 	|Did she go home?	|Where did she go?
|They went to the cinema. 	|Did they go to the cinema?	|Where did they go?

### Subject questions

In some questions, **who or what** is the subject of the verb. There is no inversion of subject and verb in these questions.

* **Who broke** the window?
* **Who is knocking** on the door?
