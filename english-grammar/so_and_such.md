# So and Such

- She's **so** interesting!
- This is **such** an interesting book.
- A new phone costs **so much money** these days.
- Traffic in the city centre is **such** a nightmare!

## Grammar explanation 

We can use **so** and **such** to intensify **adjectives**, **adverbs** and **nouns**.



### Adjectives and adverbs

We can use **so** with **an adjective** or **adverb to make it stronger**.

* It's **so** hot today!
* She looks **so** young in that photo.
* He walks **so** slowly. It's **so** annoying!

If we are using the comparative form of the **adjective or adverb**, we use **so much to make it stronger**.

+ They were **so much more innocent** when they were younger.
+ I work **so much more quickly** when I can concentrate.



### Nouns

With a **noun** or **adjective + noun**, we use **such to make it stronger**. 

- You're **such** an angel!
- It's **such** a hot day today!
- They're **such** lovely trousers. Where did you buy them?

However, when we use **much**, **many**, **little** and few with a **noun**, we use **so to make it stronger**.

* There are **so** many people here!
* I've had **so little** time to myself this week.

### Saying the result

We often use these **so** and **such structures** with that and a clause to say what the result is.

+ It was **so** cold that the water in the lake froze.
+ He was **such** a good teacher that we all passed the exam.
+ There's so much noise that I can't think!
