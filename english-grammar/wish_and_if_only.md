# Wish and If Only

- That guy is so annoying! I **wish** he'd stop talking.
- I **wish** I lived closer to my family.
- **If only** I hadn't lost her phone number. She must think I'm so rude for not calling her.
- I **wish** they wouldn't park their car in front of my house.

## Grammar explanation

We use **wish** and **if only** to talk about things that we would like to be different in either the **present** or **the past**. **If only** is usually a bit **stronger** than wish. 


### In the present

We can use **wish/if only** + **a past form** to talk about a present situation we would like to be different. 

* I **wish** you **didn't live** so far away.
* **If only** we **knew** what to do.
* He **wishes** he **could afford** a holiday.

### In the past

We can use **wish/if only** + **a past perfect form** to talk about something we would like to change about the past. 

+ They **wish** they **hadn't eaten** so much chocolate. They're feeling very sick now.
+ **If only** I'**d studied** harder when I was at school. 

### Expressing annoyance

We can use **wish** + **would(n't)** to show that we are annoyed with what someone or something does or doesn't do. We often feel that they are unlikely or unwilling to change.

- I **wish** you **wouldn't borrow** my clothes without asking.
- I **wish** it **would rain**. The garden really needs some water.
- She **wishes** he'**d work** less. They never spend any time together.
