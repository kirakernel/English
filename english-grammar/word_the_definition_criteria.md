# Word: The Definition & Criteria

In traditional grammar, **word** is the basic unit of language. **Words** can be classified according to their action and meaning, but it is challenging to define. 

A **word** refers to a speech sound, or a mixture of two or more speech sounds in both written and verbal form of language. A **word** works as a symbol to _represent/refer_ to _something/someone_ in language to communicate a specific meaning.

**Example:** _'love', 'cricket', 'sky'_ etc.

> "**[A word is the]** smallest unit of grammar that can stand alone as a complete utterance, separated by spaces in written language and potentially by pauses in speech."
_(David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language. Cambridge University Press, 2003)_


> _**Morphology**, a branch of linguistics, studies the formation of words. The branch of linguistics that studies the meaning of words is called **lexical semantics**._


There are several criteria for a speech sound, or a combination of some speech sounds to be called a **word**.

- There must be a **potential pause** in speech and a **space** in written form between two words.
**For instance**, suppose 'ball' and 'bat' are two different words. So, if we use them in a sentence, we must have a potential pause after pronouncing each of them. It cannot be like _"Idonotplaywithbatball."_ If we take pause, these sounds can be regarded as seven distinct words which are 'I,' 'do,' 'not,' 'play,' 'with,' 'bat,' and 'ball.'

* Every word must contain at least **one root**. If you break this root, it cannot be a word anymore.
**For example**, the word 'unfaithful' has a root 'faith.' If we break 'faith' into 'fa' and 'ith,' these sounds will not be regarded as words.

+ Every word must have a **meaning**.
**For example**, the sound _'lakkanah'_ has no meaning in the English language. So, it cannot be an English word.
